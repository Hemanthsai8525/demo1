    <h1>Box Model and Layout</h1>
    <p>The CSS box model is a fundamental concept that defines how elements are displayed on a page. It consists of four parts: margin, border, padding, and content. Layout techniques include block vs. inline elements, positioning (static, relative, absolute, fixed), and display properties. Advanced layout methods like Flexbox and Grid provide efficient ways to arrange elements in responsive and dynamic structures.
