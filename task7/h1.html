    <h1>HTML Basics and Structure:</h1>
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. It provides the structure for a webpage using elements enclosed in angle brackets. Every HTML document follows a basic structure that includes essential elements like the document type declaration, head section, and body section. The head contains metadata, such as the title, character encoding, and linked stylesheets, while the body contains the visible content of the webpage, including text, images, links, and other elements.</p>
