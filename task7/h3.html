    <p>Links allow navigation between different webpages or sections of a page. They can open in the same tab or a new tab and can also be used to link to external websites or downloadable files. Images enhance a webpage's visual appeal and can include alternative text for accessibility. Multimedia elements, such as audio and video, enable embedding media files directly into webpages. These elements improve user engagement and enhance the interactive experience of a website.
