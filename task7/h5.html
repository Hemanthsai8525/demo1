    <p>HTML5 introduced new elements to improve the structure and readability of webpages. Semantic elements, such as headers, navigation sections, articles, and footers, make it easier to organize content logically. These elements enhance accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO). Other HTML5 features include the <u>canvas</u> element for graphics and animations, the <u> svg </u> element for scalable vector graphics, and meta tags for mobile responsiveness and search engine optimization.</p>
