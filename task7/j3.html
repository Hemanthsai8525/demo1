    <h1>DOM Manipulation and Events:</h1>
    <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) represents a webpage as a tree structure. JavaScript can access and modify elements, changing their content, attributes, and styles dynamically. Event handling enables interaction, responding to user actions like clicks, keypresses, and mouse movements, improving webpage interactivity.</p>
