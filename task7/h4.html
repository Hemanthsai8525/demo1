    <p>Forms are essential for user interaction, allowing data submission through various input fields. Text fields collect information like names and email addresses, while checkboxes and radio buttons allow users to make selections. Dropdown lists provide multiple options in a compact format. Buttons are used to submit or reset forms. HTML5 introduced built-in validation features, such as required fields and specific input types, to improve user experience and data accuracy.</p>
