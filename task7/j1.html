    <h1>JavaScript Basics and Syntax</h1>
    <p>JavaScript (JS) is a programming language that enables interactivity on webpages. It follows a syntax based on variables, data types, operators, and expressions. Variables store values, and JavaScript supports different data types such as strings, numbers, booleans, and objects. Operators perform calculations and comparisons, forming the foundation of logic in JavaScript programs.
