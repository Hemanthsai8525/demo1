    <p>HTML elements define the structure of content on a webpage. Headings are used to create titles and subheadings, while paragraphs structure text. Formatting elements like bold, italic, underline, and emphasis help improve text readability. Lists, including ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists, organize content efficiently. Tables allow for data presentation in rows and columns, while special elements like line breaks and horizontal rules help with content separation.</p>
