    <h1>Functions, Control Flow, and Loops:</h1>
    <p>Functions allow code to be reusable and modular. They can take parameters and return values. Control flow structures like conditional statements (if-else) help execute different code based on conditions. Loops, such as for and while loops, allow repeated execution of a block of code, making JavaScript efficient for handling repetitive tasks.</p>
